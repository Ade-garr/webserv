Made with [GuiDupont](https://github.com/GuiDupont/webserv_42).

## 🔑 How to

```
make
./webserv
```

You can choose your configuration by adding one parameter.<br>
```./webserv config/default.config```<br>
Feel free to change the config file as you wish (inspired by nginx, check the subject and the different exemples to see different directives implemented).<br>

⚠️ Don't forget to change the root setting in the config file in order to match the folder wanted.
